// The onboarding page's state machine as a pure function (ordering + gates are
// unit-testable without React). OnboardingPage renders the returned state;
// useOnboardingState feeds it the query results.
//
// Precedence the page short-circuits through:
//   1. loading            — membership resolving, or (once present) the repo/team probes.
//   2. notInvited         — no membership record. A PENDING invite is NOT this
//                           (submitOnboarding accepts it before creating the repo).
//   3. pendingConfirmation — just submitted, or an onboarding repo exists.
//                           Before allSet, so a fresh submit shows pending even
//                           if team membership already activated.
//   4. allSet             — already on the classroom team.
//   5. form               — fall-through.

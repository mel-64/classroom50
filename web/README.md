# Classroom 50 GUI Alpha

The frontend for Fifty Foundation's teacher-student GitHub Pages-based assignment management and grading platform.

Built with React + TypeScript + Vite (React Compiler enabled), TanStack Router/Query, Tailwind, and daisyUI.

## Local development

Requires Node/npm.

1. `npm i`
2. Create a `.env.local` file in the repo root (gitignored) with your GitHub OAuth app client ID:

   ```bash
   VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<your-oauth-app-client-id>
   ```

3. `npm run dev` and open http://localhost:5173

### GitHub OAuth app

Sign-in requires a [GitHub OAuth app](https://github.com/settings/developers):

- **Web flow**: set the app's authorization callback URL to `http://localhost:5173/login` for local development (`https://classroom50.org/login` in production).
- **Device flow**: check "Enable Device Flow" in the OAuth app settings.

The token exchange goes through a Cloudflare Worker proxy (which holds the client secret). It defaults to the Fifty Foundation worker; override with `VITE_GITHUB_OAUTH_WORKER_BASE` in `.env.local` if you run your own.

If no `VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` is set, the app falls back to a client ID previously saved in the browser's localStorage (from older builds that had a client ID input on the login screen).

## Deployment

Pushes to `main` deploy to [classroom50.org](https://classroom50.org) via GitHub Pages (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`). The production client ID comes from the `VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` repository variable (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables) — it is a public identifier, not a secret.

Note: the deploy workflow runs `vite build` directly, skipping the `tsc` typecheck that `npm run build` performs (the codebase currently has pre-existing type errors).

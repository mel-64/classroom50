// Package githubapi is the single seam between gh-student and the
// GitHub REST API. It is the ONLY package permitted to import
// github.com/cli/go-gh/v2/pkg/api (enforced by a CI guard, not the
// compiler); every domain talks to GitHub through the transport-verb
// Client interface defined here.
//
// The interface is intentionally transport-verb-level
// (Get/Post/Patch/Request), not a per-operation domain interface —
// domain shaping belongs in the command/service layer, not in this
// seam. This mirrors cli/gh-teacher/internal/githubapi (the two CLIs
// are separate Go modules, so the seam can't be shared, only paralleled).

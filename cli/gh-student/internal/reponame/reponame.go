// Package reponame owns the canonical assignment-repo naming formula, a
// cross-binary contract shared with cli/gh-teacher (which rebuilds the
// prefix by hand in download.go — separate go.mod, no shared symbol) and
// runner.py::username_from_repo. Changing the shape here silently makes
// `gh teacher download` return zero repos and misidentifies every
// submission in scores.json, so it lives in one named seam consumed by
// every gh-student command that builds or parses a repo name.

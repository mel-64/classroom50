# GitHub Integration

This page documents every place where Classroom 50 touches GitHub's API or authentication infrastructure — what you have to do manually in a browser, what the CLI handles for you, and the complete list of REST API calls the tooling makes.

## Manual steps

### 1. Org setup (one-time, github.com web UI)

The CLI never creates the org for you. Do the following once before running any CLI commands:

1. **Create the organization** at <https://github.com/account/organizations/new>. Free orgs work for public template repos; Team or Enterprise Cloud is required for GitHub Pages from a private repo (the `classroom50` config repo is private).

2. **Flag your template repos as templates** under each repo's `Settings → General → Template repository`. Templates must also be **public** on Free and Team plans so students can read them (the "No permission" baseline prevents org members from reading private repos they aren't direct collaborators on). GitHub Enterprise Cloud's "internal" visibility is the exception — see [GitHub's docs on internal repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories#about-internal-repositories).

Org-level member privileges are locked to least-privilege automatically — `gh teacher init` applies them via `PATCH /orgs/{org}` (see the REST table below), retrying each policy individually if the combined PATCH hits a plan-gated or enterprise-locked field. After init, the only things an org member can do are create a **private** repository (needed so `gh student accept` works) and publish a **public** Pages site (enforced so the `classroom50` config repo's site — the unauthenticated `assignments.json` source — keeps working); public/internal repo creation, private Pages, repo delete/transfer, visibility changes, issue deletion, team creation, dependency insights, private-repo forking, and member-invited outside collaborators are all denied. init *enforces* (not just allows) the Pages policy, so re-running `gh teacher init` resets a teacher who tightened it back to the working state. This is what makes it safe for `gh student accept` to leave the student as **admin** of their own repo (so a group founder can add teammates with `gh student invite`) — the dangerous repo-admin powers are defanged org-wide. The fields GitHub rejects on your plan are the one case where you'd still flip them yourself at `https://github.com/organizations/<org>/settings/member_privileges`; init warns per rejected field with that link.

**Four member-privilege settings have no REST API** and `gh teacher init` cannot set or even read them — apply them manually once at `https://github.com/organizations/<org>/settings/member_privileges` (init prints this reminder too):

- **App access requests** → Members only (or Disabled)
- **GitHub Apps** → deselect "Allow repository admins to install GitHub Apps for their repositories"
- **Projects base permissions** → No access
- **Branch renames** → deselect "Allow repository administrators to rename branches protected by organization rules" (enabled by default on new orgs; defense-in-depth — the `classroom50-protect-submission-history` org ruleset already protects each repo's default branch with org-admin-only bypass, so a student-admin can't rename out of that protection. Disable it as a tidy-up.)

### 2. Teacher authentication (`gh teacher login`)

Run once per machine or after a token rotation:

```sh
gh teacher login
```

This shells out to `gh auth login -s admin:org -s workflow` and opens a browser to complete GitHub's OAuth device flow (a one-time code you enter at <https://github.com/login/device>). Neither scope is granted by a plain `gh auth login`: `admin:org` is required for org-level invitations, and `workflow` lets `gh teacher init` commit the config repo's `.github/workflows/` files via the Git Data API (GitHub returns a misleading `404` on that write without it). If you skip this step and have no token at all, the CLI detects the missing token and runs the login flow automatically. If a token exists but lacks `admin:org` or `workflow`, the affected command fails with an error telling you to run `gh teacher login` to grant the missing scope.

OAuth scopes requested by the teacher CLI:

| Scope | Required for |
|-------|--------------|
| `admin:org` | Sending org invitations, reading and removing org memberships |
| `workflow` | Committing the config repo's `.github/workflows/` files during `gh teacher init` (GitHub 404s the Git Data API write without it) |

### 3. Student authentication (`gh student login`)

Run once per student machine:

```sh
gh student login
```

Same device flow as above, but with student-appropriate scopes:

| Scope | Required for |
|-------|--------------|
| `read:org` | Checking and accepting org membership |
| `repo` | Generating private assignment repos from templates, disabling repo features, adding collaborators |
| `workflow` | Committing `.github/workflows/autograde.yaml` into the assignment repo at accept time |

### 4. Fine-grained PAT for score collection

`gh teacher init` uploads a PAT into the `CLASSROOM50_COLLECT_TOKEN` Actions secret of your `classroom50` config repo. That PAT is what the `collect-scores.yaml` workflow uses to read releases from student repos across the org.

**Create the PAT at <https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new>** (or the equivalent page for your org-owned service account — a service account is strongly recommended so the token isn't tied to a personal account):

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Resource owner | your teaching org |
| Repository access | **All repositories** ("Only select repositories" misses student repos, which `gh student accept` creates on demand after the token is minted) |
| Contents | **Read** |
| Metadata | **Read** (mandatory — GitHub auto-includes it on every fine-grained PAT; this is what lets `collect-scores` read group-repo collaborators, so group assignments need no extra scope) |
| Expiry | 1–366 days (fine-grained PATs support up to 1 year); set a calendar reminder to rotate before it expires |

> **Group assignments need no extra scope.** For a group assignment the
> autograder runs once in the first-accepter's repo and emits a single score;
> `collect_scores.py` then reads that repo's **collaborators** to fan the score
> out to every group member **on the roster** (the owner is always credited; a
> non-rostered out-of-band collaborator is excluded). Listing collaborators
> (`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/collaborators`) requires only `Metadata: read`,
> which is auto-included on every fine-grained PAT and already implied by the
> `Contents: read` grant above — so the same collect token serves individual and
> group assignments. If the collaborator read fails for any reason, the group
> submission still scores for the repo owner and `collect-scores` logs a
> `::warning::` naming the repo.

Supply the PAT to `gh teacher init` via the environment variable (never a flag — command-line PATs leak via shell history):

```sh
CLASSROOM50_COLLECT_TOKEN=github_pat_... gh teacher init <org>
```

Or omit it and the CLI prompts for it with hidden TTY input. The token is encrypted with libsodium sealbox before being uploaded to GitHub and is never written to disk.

To rotate an expiring token, create a new one with the same settings and run:

```sh
CLASSROOM50_COLLECT_TOKEN=github_pat_... gh teacher rotate-collect-token <org>
```

### 5. GitHub Pages (automatic, but requires Actions to run)

`gh teacher init` enables Pages programmatically via [`POST https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pages`](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pages/pages#create-a-github-pages-site) and sets visibility to public via [`PUT https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pages`](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pages/pages#update-information-about-a-github-pages-site). The Pages site is built by the `publish-pages.yaml` workflow that `init` commits into the config repo. **The first Pages deployment requires the workflow to run at least once** — either push a commit to the default branch or trigger it manually from the Actions tab. The CLI prints the expected Pages URL (`https://<org>.github.io/classroom50/`) after `init` finishes; it may take a minute to go live.

If `init` warns that the org-level workflow token policy is too restrictive (the endpoint is org-scoped and requires an org owner to change it), you can apply it yourself:

```sh
gh api -X PUT /orgs/<org>/actions/permissions/workflow \
  -f default_workflow_permissions=write \
  -f can_approve_pull_request_reviews=false
```

Similarly, if the reusable workflow access warning fires:

```sh
gh api -X PUT /repos/<org>/classroom50/actions/permissions/access \
  -f access_level=organization
```

### 6. Score collection

Scores are collected by the `collect-scores.yaml` Actions workflow in your `classroom50` config repo. It runs on a nightly cron (`17 4 * * *` UTC) automatically once `init` is done. To trigger it manually:

```sh
gh workflow run collect-scores.yaml --repo <org>/classroom50
gh workflow run collect-scores.yaml --repo <org>/classroom50 -f classroom=<short-name>   # single classroom
```

Or use the **Actions** tab on `<org>/classroom50` → `collect-scores.yaml` → **Run workflow**.

## GitHub REST API reference

The CLIs call the GitHub REST API through [`go-gh`](https://github.com/cli/go-gh) (`RESTClient`), which resolves paths relative to `https://api.github.com` on github.com or `https://<host>/api/v3` on GitHub Enterprise Server. The `collect_scores.py` script uses Python's `urllib` with a `Bearer` token. No Octokit, no axios, no raw `fetch()`.

### `gh teacher` CLI

| GET | [`https://api.github.com/orgs/{org}`](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/orgs/orgs#get-an-organization) | Check org plan (warn if Pages from a private repo requires Team or Enterprise Cloud) |
| PATCH | [`https://api.github.com/orgs/{org}`](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/orgs/orgs#update-an-organization) | Lock down org member privileges to least-privilege at `init` time. The only enabled member capabilities are private repo creation (`members_can_create_private_repositories: true`) and public Pages creation (`members_can_create_pages: true` + `members_can_create_public_pages: true`, **enforced** so the config repo's public Pages site can publish — re-running init resets it). Everything else is denied: `default_repository_permission: "none"`, and `false` for public/internal repo creation, private Pages, repo delete/transfer, repo visibility change, issue deletion, team creation, dependency-insights viewing, private-repo forking, member-invited outside collaborators, and read-access discussion creation. Combined PATCH with a per-field retry on 403/422 so a plan-gated field only warns. |

### `collect_scores.py` (runs inside GitHub Actions, uses `CLASSROOM50_COLLECT_TOKEN`)

| Method | URL | Purpose |
|--------|-----|---------|
| GET | [`https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest`](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases/releases#get-the-latest-release) | Fetch the latest release for a student's assignment repo |
| GET | [`https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases`](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases/releases#list-releases) | List recent releases (fallback when latest isn't a `submit/*` tag) |
| GET | [`https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/assets/{asset_id}`](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases/assets#get-a-release-asset) | Download the `result.json` asset from a release |

### `autograde-runner.yaml` (reusable workflow, runs in student repos)

These calls happen inside the autograde workflow on every student submission. `GH_TOKEN` is set to `${{ github.token }}` (the student repo's `GITHUB_TOKEN`).

| Method | URL | Purpose |
|--------|-----|---------|
| POST | [`https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/statuses/{sha}`](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/commits/statuses#create-a-commit-status) | Post a `classroom50/autograde` commit status (pending → success/failure) |

The workflow also uses `git tag` + `git push` against the student's repo to create the `submit/<UTC-timestamp>-<short-sha>` tag for branch-triggered runs, and `gh release` subcommands (`view`, `edit`, `upload`, `create`) to publish the `result.json` asset on the submission tag release. The latest-pointer flip lives in a separate `set-latest` job with a per-repo concurrency group so concurrent submissions can't race on the read-modify-write.

The runner setup also fetches from GitHub Pages without authentication (public by design):

| Method | URL | Purpose |
|--------|-----|---------|
| GET | `https://{org}.github.io/classroom50/{classroom}/assignments.json` | Load the classroom's assignment manifest (and the per-assignment runtime block for the grade job) |
| GET | `https://{org}.github.io/classroom50/runner.py` | Fetch the runner-side bootstrap (org-level; one per config repo, shared across all classrooms) |
| GET | `https://{org}.github.io/classroom50/{classroom}/autograder.py` | Fetch the classroom default autograder (only when set via `gh teacher autograder set-default` and the assignment has no per-assignment override). 404 → runner publishes a vacuous-pass result. |
| GET | `https://{org}.github.io/classroom50/{classroom}/autograders/{slug}.tar.gz` | Download the per-assignment bundle (entrypoint `autograder.py` plus any sibling fixtures; fetched by `runner.py` at runtime) |

---

## GitHub Actions workflows

### Scaffolded by `gh teacher init` into each `<org>/classroom50` config repo

| File | Triggers | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `publish-pages.yaml` | Push to default branch, `workflow_dispatch` | Deploy `assignments.json`, classroom-default `autograder.py` files, autograder workflow shims, the runner-side bootstrap, and per-assignment bundles to GitHub Pages |
| `collect-scores.yaml` | `workflow_dispatch`, cron `17 4 * * *` UTC | Run `collect_scores.py`, aggregate `result.json` assets into `*/scores.json` |
| `autograde-runner.yaml` (reusable) | Called from each student's `autograde.yaml` | Set up runtime (toolchains, container) per `assignments.json`, fetch `runner.py` from Pages, run it, publish commit status and submit-tag release |

---

## Environment variables and secrets summary

| Variable / Secret | Where set | Used by | Purpose |
|-------------------|-----------|---------|---------|
| `CLASSROOM50_COLLECT_TOKEN` | `gh teacher init` (Actions secret on `classroom50`) | `collect-scores.yaml`, `collect_scores.py` | Fine-grained PAT for reading student repo releases |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` / `github.token` | Automatically injected by Actions | `autograde-runner.yaml` | Student-repo Actions token (`contents: write`, `statuses: write`) |
| `GH_TOKEN` | Set from `github.token` in runner steps | `gh api`, `gh release` inside the runner | `gh` CLI auth inside the autograde workflow |
| `GH_DEBUG=api` | Developer shell | `go-gh` (teacher & student CLIs) | Log all REST request/response traffic |
| `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER` | Actions context | `collect_scores.py` | Org name inside the collect workflow |
| `GITHUB_API_URL` | Actions context | `collect_scores.py` | API base URL (supports GitHub Enterprise Server) |
| `GH_API_URL` | Test override | `collect_scores.py` tests | Override API base in unit tests |

The teacher and student CLIs do not use `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GH_TOKEN`. They read credentials from the `gh` auth store (typically `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml`), populated by `gh teacher login` / `gh student login`.
